Face to face with the bandit leader, I knew I had only one chance. I challenged him to a duel. He accepted, and we drew swords. We fought through the night, his dastardly men shouting and cheering all the while. As the sun peaked over the eastern hills, the bandit leader revealed a moment of weakness and I struck. He fell, his face marked eternally with an expression of shock. His band of brutes scattered immediately and in their confusion ran directly into a patrol passing on the nearby highway. I reported the defeat of the bandit gang to the villagers and received my reward. I now return to the Adventure Guild.",

A grey figure appeared before me, not standing but suspended as a man-sized puppet. Seeming at first to be dead, its eyes suddenly sprung open in rage and two imps of the wizard attacked! I fought off the imps, finally lunging forth to bury my blade in the heart of the dark wizard. In a panic the imps disappeared into a magic circle, presumably returning to the plane from whence they came. The lair was silent once more, but calm and peaceful.
