I waited at the palisade for the gryphon's return. After only a few hours I heard the dread cry of the beast. I saw it soon thereafter, flying in the sky, approaching from the west.\n\nFirst it struck an empty building destroying it like dried twigs. Then it came to the ground and began searching for the villagers. I took my opportunity to strike. With a deft swing of blade, I wounded its left wing. It cried out and struck back, knocking me clear across the street. Back and forth our duel tipped, for hours upon hours.\n\nAs the sun began to set I lit a torch that I might continue to fight in the dark. Therein I realized my opportunity for victory. As the gryphon lunged I stepped deftly to the side and struck out with the torch, connecting with the beast's eye and blinding it. In its rage and without proper sight it lunged clumsily. My blade struck true. The beast thrashed and stumbled, collapsing upon the peaks of the palisade.\n\nThe villagers came forth from the hall cheering and praising the mighty feat. Ealdorman Westnedge embraced me before handing me the reward for the contract. With the villagers of Crast now safe and payment in hand, I return to the Adventure Guild.",

This band of a dozen leaders were in the captain's cabin of the largest ship in the port, a great vessel with red and black sails. I slipped silently into the water and approached unnoticed. Once onboard, I found several barrels of grog, which by its smell was likely both potent and flamable. I quietly tipped the barrels over, allowing the liquid to spill over the deck. Once I deemed it sufficient, I took a torch from a nearby bracket and lit the grog. The flame spread immediately, tracking along the spilled grog and then quickly spreading to the lower sails. The pirate leaders roared with rage when they saw the ship burning. They burst from the cabin, swords drawn, but the damage was done. The other pirates, seeing their leaders' ship burning, began to flee. I leapt from the deck and swam back to shore, watching as the pirate leaders futilely attempted to douse the flames. With the brunt of the pirate force now departed, I sped back to a nearby guard outpost and rallied assistance. Returning to the burning ship we found the pirate leaders sprawled on the dock, exhausted, their ship still in flames. The guards arrested the corsairs who were now too tired to put up a fight.

I scaled the cliffside and watched as the great dragon approached. Its wings were like the sails of a monstrous skyborne ship, filling fore and back with wind as the beast beat its great limbs upward and down. Like a river of flame the monster spewed forth its destruction upon the land, blasting back and forth an inferno that consumed farmlands, roadways, and any structures therein. As it approached I readied my grappling hook and hid from sight. It passed near the cliff and the wind from its wings was nearly unbearable, hot and wreaking of sulfur. In that moment I sprang forth and leapt from the cliff, swinging the grapple in a wide arc. I threw it and, as I began to fall toward the earth, felt the line grow taut; it had latched onto the dragon's back! I climbed the line, mounted the dragon and began striking it with my blade. It cried out in anger with a deafening screech rolling in the air in an attempt to throw me. The grapple still lodged in its back, I tied the rope tightly around my waist so as not to be removed, and continued my onslaught. I struck the wings and the beast began to drift to the left and right, unsteady in the air. I ventured to crawl forward toward the creature's head, and landed a blow to its left eye, rendering it useless forevermore. The beast wailed, rolled once more, and fell to the earth with a thunderous crash./n/nI removed myself from the grapple and leapt away just as the beast rolled over and over in an attempt to crush its assailant. I dodged and hid with all the stealth I could muster as the dragon once again spewed a torrent of conflagration, craning back and forth to find me. Finally it spotted me; its eyes were rubies of focused rage, its lips curled to reveal rows of dagger-like teeth. With the speed of a snake the dragon lunged forth, and I was not fast enough to evade. In an instant I felt great jaws close around me, a rough slithering tongue below, forcing me toward the abyss. With a final burst of strength I plunged my sword upward and felt it sink deep into the roof of the monster's mouth. It screamed and heat began to build in that darkness; I had mere moments to end this. I withdrew the blade and struck again, and again. A dozen times I withdrew and struck again, each time deepening the gouge in the roof of the beast's mouth. Finally, it opened its mouth for a final blast of flame and I leapt free, pulling my sword out with me. The dragon spewed forth its river of flame, but my plan had worked. Flame spilled forth not only from its mouth now, but from its nose and eyes. It screamed in agony as the cavities of its skull filled with its own conflagration and burned the monster from the inside. With a final cry the dragon fell, the earth shuddering with the impact. There it lay silent, and cold evermore./n/nI returned to the Child Prince with a trophy of the dragon. With the Kingdom of Calan indebted to us and the Prince Aethelric II an eternal ally, I now return to the Adventure Guild.",
