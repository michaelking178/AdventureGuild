The students fanned out and one stepped forward as Fyrheort explained how to remain level-headed in a fight. I began to feel more as a prop than a participant. Fyrheort screamed at the students to continue to slam me regardless of my condition. Luckily, another headmage heard the commotion and brought an end to the chaos. As I was carried out in a daze I heard Fyrheort lecturing on urgency and hesitation in battle. The other head-mages settled my payment and I returned to the Adventure Guild.",

We fought through the night, his dastardly men shouting and cheering all the while. As the sun peaked over the eastern hills, the bandit leader revealed a moment of weakness and I struck. He fell, his face marked eternally with an expression of shock. His band of brutes scattered immediately and in their confusion ran directly into a patrol passing on the nearby highway.
